You should optimize your model for precision when you want to decrease the number of false positives.\n","\n","F1 score is calculated by taking the harmonic mean of precision and recall and ranges from 0 to 1. Harmonic mean has a nice arithmetic property representing a truly balanced mean. If either precision or recall is low, it suffers significantly.\n","\n","\"If you have a high class imbalance, always choose the F1 score because a high F1 score considers both precision and recall.\" To get a high F1, both false positives and false negatives must be low. \n","\n","Reference:\n","\n","https://towardsdatascience.com/comprehensive-guide-on-multiclass-classification-metrics-af94cfb83fbd\n","\n","https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/71700/how-to-draw-roc-curve-with-three-response-variable\n","\n","https://www.datascienceblog.net/post/machine-learning/performance-measures-multi-class-problems/"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":11,"status":"ok","timestamp":1655909114324,"user":{"displayName":"Di Zhen","userId":"09127853115016959956"},"user_tz":240},"id":"487NCcPIeoXX","outputId":"69907d68-804d-4f4f-df6e-2f4bc4a29b47"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["array([0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9])"]},"execution_count":54,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["macro_thresholds = np.array(range(1,10))/10\n","macro_thresholds"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":7020,"status":"ok","timestamp":1655909121340,"user":{"displayName":"Di Zhen","userId":"09127853115016959956"},"user_tz":240},"id":"PsFabfHqeq8r","outputId":"be247be3-9f4d-47f5-f64e-f4529af79d5e"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Best Threshold:  0.73\n","Test F1 Accuracy:  0.6644462947543713\n","Test Flat Accuracy:  0.8837256556941449 \n","\n","               precision    recall  f1-score   support\n","\n","        toxic       0.58      0.83      0.68      6090\n"," severe_toxic       0.46      0.22      0.30       367\n","      obscene       0.62      0.77      0.69      3691\n","       threat       0.72      0.22      0.33       211\n","       insult       0.74      0.61      0.67      3427\n","identity_hate       0.76      0.41      0.53       712\n","\n","    micro avg       0.62      0.72      0.66     14498\n","    macro avg       0.65      0.51      0.53     14498\n"," weighted avg       0.63      0.72      0.66     14498\n","  samples avg       0.07      0.07      0.07     14498\n","\n"]},{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/sklearn/metrics/_classification.py:1318: UndefinedMetricWarning: Precision and F-score are ill-defined and being set to 0.0 in samples with no predicted labels.
